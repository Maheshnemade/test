Updated README.md after Resolving Merge Conflict

Merged the conflicting sections in the README.md file to ensure a coherent and accurate project description. The merge conflict was resolved by combining both sets of changes to provide a comprehensive overview of the project's goals and how to use it. Also included my personal details in the specified format as per the interview instructions.
